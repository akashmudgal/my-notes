## The Problem

Suppose you have a scenario where you have to ensure that there only ever is a single instance of a class in your application. For example, let's say in your application, you create a class which manages provides methods to manage database connections. You need to ensure that there is only ever a single database connection used in your application, since opening and closing a database connection is a costly operation.
## The Solution

The *Singleton* Design Pattern provides a way to solve this problem. You create a class in such a way, that if an instance of it exists already in the memory, a new instance is not created - instead, the already existing instance in the memory is returned.

## Example

For implementing the *Singleton* pattern, we define the class with a private constructor - to prevent the external instantiation of the class. We provide a method within the class, which return if the instance of the class exists already, and if not, we create a new instance, and return it.

There are two approaches for it as well - Lazy instantiation, and Eager instantiation. 

In Eager instantiation, the instance of the class is created when it is first loaded into the memory. 

In Lazy instantiation, the instance of the class is created when it is first retrieved.

For example, for out `DBConnectionManager` class:

```Java
public class DBConnectionManager {
	private static DBConnectionManager instance;

	public static DBConnectionManager getInstance(){
		if(this.instance == null) {
			this.instance = new DBConnectionManager();
		}
		return instance;
	}
	
	public void connect() {
		System.out.println("Connected to the database."); 
	}        
	public void disconnect() {
		System.out.println("Disconnected from the database."); 
	}
}
```
## Ensuring Thread Safety in a Singleton

While the above approach works, it isn't exactly thread safe. To ensure thread safety, we have to ensure that multiple threads can access can the instance safely. Here is one of the thread safe implementations:

```Java
public class DBConnectionManager {
	private static volatile DBConnectionManager instance;

	public static DBConnectionManager getInstance(){
		
		if (instance == null) {
			synchronized (Singleton.class) {
				if (instance == null) {
					instance = new Singleton(); 
				} 
			} 
		}
		return instance;
	}
	
	public void connect() {
		System.out.println("Connected to the database."); 
	}        
	public void disconnect() {
		System.out.println("Disconnected from the database."); 
	}
}
```

Another great way to implement a singleton in Java is to use the `Enum` construct. Enums are guaranteed to be thread safe in Java.

```Java
public Enum Singleton {
	INSTANCE;
	
	public void someMethod(){
		// some code
	}
}
```
